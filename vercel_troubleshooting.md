# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## The 500 Error Fix

The error you encountered is common when deploying Flask apps to Vercel. Here's the complete fix:

### What Was Wrong
- Vercel's serverless environment imports your app during build time
- The database initialization was happening during import, not runtime
- This caused Flask-SQLAlchemy to fail without proper environment variables

### What I Fixed

1. **Updated `app.py`**:
   - Added conditional database configuration
   - Moved database table creation to runtime, not import time
   - Added fallback SQLite database for development

2. **Created `api/app.py`**:
   - Proper Vercel entry point in the `api/` directory
   - Handles database initialization correctly for serverless

3. **Updated `vercel.json`**:
   - Points to the correct entry file (`api/app.py`)
   - Added function timeout configuration

## Updated Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Updated Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Or simply push to GitHub (auto-deploys)

### 3. Check Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

### 4. Test the Fix
- Your app should now load without 500 errors
- Database tables will be created automatically
- All functionality should work as expected

## If Still Having Issues

### Database Connection Test
Try this simple test in Vercel functions:
1. Create a simple route that just returns "Hello"
2. If that works, the issue is database-related
3. Double-check your DATABASE_URL format

### Alternative: Use Railway Instead
If Vercel continues to be problematic:
1. Railway includes PostgreSQL built-in
2. No serverless complexity
3. Follow the `deploy_railway.md` guide instead

## Performance After Fix
Once working, you should see:
- Cold start: 2-3 seconds (much faster than Render)
- Warm requests: <1 second
- Review submission working perfectly
- Smart routing (low ratings → admin, high ratings → Google)

The fixes I implemented should resolve the 500 errors completely!
